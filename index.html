            <h2>GED0001 Course Experience Essay</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Specialized English 1 (GED0001) has been an experience. It is a course that has helped sharpen my critical thinking and communication skills 
            through various topics. Learning about Ethos, Pathos, and Logos was particularly enjoyable because these rhetorical strategies felt intuitive 
            and easy to grasp. They made me more conscious of how arguments are structured, whether in academic texts or casual online conversations. 
            Similarly, paraphrasing was straightforward to practice, as it felt like second nature when simplifying information while chatting with friends 
            or summarizing ideas for personal projects. These topics were not only practical but also gave me confidence in articulating ideas more effectively. </p>

            <p>However, I found it much more challenging to stay focused when working through the larger reading materials. Articles like Noam Chomsky’s "The False
             Promise of ChatGPT" or F.R. (Ruud) Van der Weel and Audrey L.H. Van der Meer’s "Handwriting but not Typewriting Leads to Widespread Brain Connectivity" 
             were packed with thought-provoking arguments but required a significantly large amount of focus to fully process. It’s not that the content wasn’t interesting—
             I just often found my mind wandering when the paragraphs felt dense or overly formal.</p>
             
            <p>Overall, this course has been both a challenge and a growth opportunity. The easier topics built my confidence, while the difficult readings pushed me to 
             stretch my focus and patience. I appreciate how the course materials encouraged a mix of intellectual exploration and practical application, which made the 
             learning experience feel relevant to my everyday life. While I still struggle with lengthy texts, I’ve learned how to break them into smaller parts and use 
             strategies like paraphrasing to make them more manageable. Specialized English 1 has definitely made me more aware of how I approach information and communicate 
             ideas, and I look forward to applying these skills in future coursework.</p>
